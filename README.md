Speed Optimisation of WordPress Website in Mobile Version

I am trying to optimise wordpress website's at Google Developer, but in mobile version I am not getting proper results now. Even though I had tried many thing (plugins(w3c, auto optimise, speed booster)/custom codes), but now in desktop version speed is ok, but in mobile version speed is showing very low. what will be its possible solutions???
